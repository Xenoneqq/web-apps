# WEB APPS  
A collection of web applications created for a college class  

During our web app classes, we worked on various small projects. Some of them were more extensive and can be found in this repository. Below is a brief overview of the completed projects.  

## ðŸ’¬ Custom About Page  

The first project involved creating a simple "About" page showcasing a product or project. In my case, I chose to feature **Entity Zero**, one of my other projects. The goal was to practice CSS styling, build a responsive layout, and structure engaging content effectively.  

## ðŸ“Ÿ JavaScript Tests  

This project consists of basic **JavaScript** programs focused on working with timers and writing custom functions, including the use of callbacks. The purpose was to prepare us for the next, more complex task.  

## ðŸ§Ÿ Zombie Game  

The final small project was a **zombie shooter game** built with JavaScript. It features a custom update function to handle zombie movement. The objective is to survive as long as possible. The player can **right-click** anywhere on the screen to shoot at a chosen position.
